# hello-world

My name is Collin Beder, I am a male that is 23 years of age.

This is my first GitHub Repository &amp; I am just trying to learn how GitHub works. From this point I would love to become a developer and learn to code, design, invent, and create stuff that society needs.

This is the first time going through the GitHub tutorial and I am learning everything that GitHub has to offer. 

I am writing this on 4:45 PM in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It is Tuesday, April 10th, 2018.
